An educational attempt at a few things : 
- CQRS architecture 
- Event Sourcing
- Kafka 
- MQTT (Todo)

Improvements / TODOs : 
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Encapsulate the EventDb / Kafka event firing into a transaction to avoid half committed events.
- ~~Dockerize it all~~
- ~~Postman~~
- Tests
- Improve this README, I want to add some architecture schema at least
